Using Batch File with start /B:-->

You can also create a batch file that runs your PowerShell script in the background using the start /B command.

@echo off
start /B powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\YourScript.ps1"

==================

1. Using VBScript as a Wrapper

Creating a VBScript file to execute your PowerShell script is one of the most effective ways to ensure it runs completely hidden.
VBScript Example:

-----
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ""C:\Path\To\YourScript.ps1""", 0, False
-----

Save this code as RunHidden.vbs and execute it. The 0 parameter ensures that no window is shown when the script runs.

===================

2. Using PowerShell with -WindowStyle Hidden

While using the -WindowStyle Hidden option is common, it may still briefly show a window due to Windows limitations. However, it's still worth mentioning for scenarios where a quick flash is acceptable.

Example Command:


powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File "C:\Path\To\YourScript.ps1"


This command attempts to run the script without displaying a window, but be aware of the potential brief visibility.
