Set Up the LNK File:

    Create a Windows shortcut (LNK) file that points to mshta.exe and passes the path to xlab22.hta as an argument.

plaintext

    Target: mshta.exe "C:\path\to\xlab22.hta"

    Package Everything into a ZIP Archive:
        Zip the LNK file and any other necessary files into a single archive.

    Host the Files on a Remote Server:
        Ensure that xlab22.hta, 311.hta, and powershellscript.ps1 are hosted on a remote server accessible to the target machine.

    Social Engineer the Target:
        Entice the user into opening the ZIP archive, which will trigger the LNK file and start the attack chain.

Setting Up a Reverse Shell in Kali

    Start a Listener in Kali:
        Open a terminal in Kali and start a Netcat listener on the port you specified in the PowerShell script (e.g., 4444).

    bash

nc -lvnp 4444

Execute the Attack:

    Follow the steps above to create and deliver the malicious payload to the target machine.

Gain a Reverse Shell:

    Once the target executes the PowerShell script, you should see a reverse shell connection in your Kali terminal.
